Many real estate agents and clients think of negotiation as simply how they price their listing or their offer to buy. Maybe they include the concept of a counter offer in their bag of negotiation tools. The truth is that proper negotiation is much more than simplythe price on a home or earnest deposit used in the offer. I’ve written a paragraph on a few of the most common opportunities and mistakes that I see in real estate transactions in Dubai. My goal is to get you thinking about how many different ways there are to improve the outcome of your transaction. Once you put this foremost in your mind, you will begin to identify other opportunities unique to your particular transaction.

Negotiation is Really an Art in Real Estate

Never take an adversarial or even aggressive posture in ANY of your interactions with real estate agents, buyers or sellers. Actually, just the opposite, you must be easy to get along with and easy to talk to. BUT NEVER FORGET that you are there for one reason; to solve your real estate needs whether you are buying or selling. This means that while you are negotiating the deal, every piece of information that you provide to "the other side" should be carefully released at just the right time, spoken in just the right way and designed to improve your position in the transaction. Experience has shown that the "art of negotiation" is not just a simple isolated exchange, but rather a continuing effort. You must remember every action that you take during the entire transaction beginning with submittal of offer to close of escrow is part of this negotiation. I have seen many real estate transactions where the Buyer or Seller got past the “Offer and Acceptance” phase and then acted like the deal was done. You know what they say about the opera, “It ‘ain’t over till the County Recorder Sings”. Don’t give up your position too early, don’t make unnecessary concessions, and don’t compromise without gain.

Structure the Offer for Acceptance

A good buyer's agent will coach their clients about the best ways to position themselves and their offer to increase the likelihood of the Seller’s acceptance. This is true even in a strong buyer's market; because if you want to pay the lowest price for piece of property, you then have to be sure that all the other components to your offer, other than price, are as attractive as possible. Remember that while price is very important to the Seller, so are other aspects of the deal. The Seller only wants to go through the escrow process ONE TIME, so if all the components of your offer must say “I can CLOSE”, your lower-price offer may be preferable to a higher offer that says “I am not so sure this is the right house and I may be a pain and NOT close escrow”. Believe me; this happens most of the times in Dubai.

The Home Inspection is a Frequent Negotiation Tool

Negotiation is just as critical on the seller side of the transaction. For example, many buyer-agents in Dubai will advise their clients to demand hefty price reductions from the seller for relatively minor repairs that are discovered during the Buyer’s home inspection. Most Buyers believe that if the cost of the repair is 1,000AED, they should get a 2,000-4,000 AED reduction in the asking price. To some extent this is justifiable because you often don’t know the exact cost until the repair is done. Furthermore, if the Buyer has to coordinate the repair, they should be reimbursed for their time and effort. However, there are agents that actually advise buyers to go ahead and make an offer close to the full list price on the home, knowing very well that there will be “something” on the inspection report they can use to get price reductions. When these items are discovered, the Buyer then demands unreasonable price reductions to the point that the Seller would never have entered the escrow had they known the price the Buyer really wanted to pay. The Buyer is effectively negotiating the price of the home “after the fact”.

By the time some Sellers get to this point in the transaction, all they want is for the home to close escrow. They are tired of the process and often willing to reduce the price just to keep things moving along. A good listing agent should advise that the Seller get a home inspection before they even list the property, and then fix the items discovered in the inspection. This approach completely removes the home inspection as a bargaining tool from the buyer’s side of the transaction. Even if you don’t want to invest the money to repair the items, you can still give the list of needed repairs to a potential buyer before they offer, stating that their offer needs to reflect acceptance of these items. Then you know the price reduction they expect BEFORE you get into a lengthy escrow.

Don’t Insult the Other Side of Your Transaction

This is perhaps the first place many negotiations fail. There is an art to creating an offer to buy a home at the best price. Most people understand that if you walk up to a person selling their home and say to them; “I think you are stupid and I want to buy your home so here is my offer”, the chances that the seller will actually look at your offer is pretty low. This is because you have put the seller into a compromised position. You have forced the seller’s sense of pride to over-rule their desire to sell the home. Once you have put the seller in this position, it is difficult to correct it. Saying something like; “Sorry I called you stupid. Here is an extra 50,000AED to make up for that”, probably isn’t going to fix things. Maybe offering 150,000AED to make them feel better would work, but then “Stupid is as Stupid Does”. I have seen very few buyers able to correct the mistake of insulting the seller. Pride is a really big deal. So, most people understand the obvious concept, but people often don’t realize how many different ways that you can put EITHER a seller or buyer into this defensive position. I have seen buyers take the approach of including a defect-list in their offer which highlights every undesirable feature in the property. They do this sometimes to support a low offer. Either way, this is the same thing as saying “Your house is bad and here is why”. The seller is insulted and either discards the offer, or counters at a higher price than they might have if they were NOT insulted. It is a counterproductive negotiation technique.

Negotiate with DATA, not Opinion

I am not suggesting that price negotiations shouldn’t occur. Of course they should. The challenge is to identify a very good price that is justified by market comparables, but yet the offer is submitted in such a fashion that it does not insult the seller. The use of market data to prepare and then support your offer is by far the most effective tool in a price negotiation. Showing a seller market data is way more persuasive than simply saying “I just feel like you are over-priced”. Another reason market data helps is because many real estate agents barely know how to perform a competent market analysis (CMA). They don’t really KNOW what the property is worth. If the Buyer-agent produces data that supports their client’s offer, many times the seller’s agent will be swayed by the data and will recommend that their seller-client accept the offer. The mirror image of this (Seller prices high to allow room to negotiate) has the same effect on insulting the Buyer and forcing a lost negotiation. A good listing agent will help the Seller create a package that shows the value of the home using market data. Again, this is way more persuasive than opinion.

Timing is Always Part of a Good Negotiation

Another consideration in helping a buyer create an offer is how soon will the listing expire? Most listings in Dubai are for 90 days and at the end of that time the seller has a choice of relisting with the current agent , OR choosing a completely different agent. Changing agents is not uncommon. Human nature tells us that the closer we are to the expiration of the listing, the more likely the listing agent is to give the offer a positive recommendation. Sellers also view this as a sort of “deadline” because it is a milestone in the progress of selling their home, and often they are also more willing to negotiate as the end of the listing nears. Getting a new agent or even extending the current listing feels like a failure.

Always Create a Counter Offer

Sometimes a seller will get offended by a low-ball offer and refuse to make a counter offer. In my opinion, for a Seller, it is “almost” always worth a shot to counter back to a buyer with a reasonable price, even if they submitted a low offer. As a listing agent, I will counsel my client (very early) that sellers who can disengage their emotions about the home and view the sale as a business transaction, tend to do better than sellers making emotional decisions during the sale. I am not saying this is easy, but a good agent can really help by talking you through this process and making it easier. Some real estate listing agents won’t spend the time required to type-up a counter offer unless the original offer is “in the ballpark”. They therefore might counsel their seller clients to wait for another, “more legitimate” offer. Honestly it really doesn't take that much time to draft-up a counter offer, and you can make the duration of the offer a single day if you like. Unexpected things happen to people every single day and even if an offer does not appear to be “serious”, you never know until you ask. I would put this in the category of "a million little things done right". I have seen buyers where the wife or the husband felt compelled to create a low-ball offer, simply because they thought that that was "just the way things were done". I have even seen situations when the other member disagreed, and went along with it simply to support their spouse. BUT, when the counter offer came back from the seller, the spouse who was in disagreement with the low offer simply stated "Now it is my turn" and submitted a legitimate offer. You just never know. I do not recommend endless back and forth offers if there is no significant movement towards common ground, but I do suggest that in most cases, at least one volley back across the fence is worth the effort.

Incentives Can be Offered by Sellers Too

There are many different kinds of incentives that a seller can offer, or a buyer can request in the transaction, and they are all part of the negotiation. Common incentives in the Santa Rosa area might include; " Reduce the price / Pay points for the buyer / Help with the down-payment / Help with closing cost / Offering a home warranty / Pay future fees or landscaping and pool maintenance "

There is so much more

OK, I have probably put you to sleep with all this information. Sorry. The fact is that I am passionate about real estate and LOVE the negotiation. I creatively help People to prepare for, and execute their best deal in any real estate transaction.
